In the early 1960s, a series of organizations began introducing film workshops across New York City. At the center of the movement was Rodger Larson, DeeDee Halleck and Bruce Spiegel who set up film workshops among youth in neighborhoods such as Harlem and the Lower East Side.  As the model spread, workshops opened including the Community Film Workshop Council, which founded workshops across the country.
