Workshops opened up across the country to offer locals access to cameras.  They emerged among minority communities and in low-income neighborhoods with the goal of providing access to the tools of communication.  They offered a space to learn, play, create and communicate.  The workshops focuses ranged from vocational training for the film industry to being a place that offered a mechanism for self-expression, ranging from experimental art to social issues.  Workshops shifted over time due to funding, technology and the communities they resided in. To learn more, choose a city to explore their workshops.
